## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the note: 
  Unexecutable code in man/get_gd.Rd:
   stats:
   
   and:
  Missing Rd-tags:
      get_gd.Rd: \value

Proper value has been added. 


## Initial release

### R CMD check results

0 errors ✓ | 0 warnings ✓ | 0 note ✓

* There was one Note before:
The Date field is over a month old.

It has been fixed.
