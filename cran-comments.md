## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a web reference for the API in the form <https:.....> to the
description of the DESCRIPTION file with no space after 'https:' and
angle brackets for auto-linking.


## Initial release

### R CMD check results

0 errors ✓ | 0 warnings ✓ | 0 note ✓

* There was one Note before:
The Date field is over a month old.

It has been fixed.
